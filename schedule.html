	<h1> Workshop Format </h1>

	        <p>
            <b>Workshop Format</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will have three kinds of activities at the workshop:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Invited talks:</b> We will be inviting leading and emerging thinkers in the field to present at the workshop. 
            There will be no publication associated with these talks, but the talks will be recorded and made available 
            through the workshop website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Poster papers and presentations at the workshop:</b> Each poster paper will be 2 pages in length (plus references). 
            The poster session will be held using Gather Town which gives the feeling of actually moving about in a physical 
            space and multiple attendees interacting concurrently with the authors. This has been used to good effect in 
            forums like NeurIPS 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Panel:</b> We will have a panel focused on a set of closely related topics within the ambit of the workshop. 
            Examples would be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What should we learn and what should we unlearn from computing systems to build reliable and secure 
                    distributed learning solutions? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can we learn reliably and in a privacy-sensitive manner while being agile to environmental changes?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is heterogeneity in distributed learning a blessing or a curse?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are the killer apps for distributed learning?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can academics, practitioners, and government collaborate in this space?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            After the workshop, we will aggregate a selected group of participants and author an article that serves 
            as a review and a vision of the road ahead. This follows in the line of such an article that has been done 
            on the topic from a ML standpoint["Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning" Kairouz, McMahan et al., December 2019].
