        <h1>Systems Challenges in Reliable and Secure Federated Learning</h1>
        <p>
            We propose to organize a workshop on the systems challenges raised by the area of federated (machine) learning, 
            or more generally, distributed learning. We will focus on how to achieve reliable and secure learning 
            considering that federated learning relies on a distributed set of nodes, often geographically distributed, 
            not physically secured, heterogeneous, and with varying levels of resource constraints. The workshop will lead 
            to a first-of-its-kind vision paper that will synthesize the progress we have made, the overarching technical 
            problems we have to solve, and the 5 most compelling usage scenarios. We will plan on holding this workshop 
            annually, rotating among security and systems venues.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far the flourishing work in federated learning in the ML community hints at important systems challenges, 
            which have neither been carefully articulated in a systems forum nor seen concerted solution efforts. Some 
            representative topics for the workshop are (all in the context of federated learning) trusted execution 
            environments, resilience to attacks, intermittent or low bandwidth network connectivity, asynchronous vs 
            synchronous network models, and heterogeneity (devices, data, models). The event will draw academics, 
            government lab scientists, and industrial practitioners.
        </p>
        <p>
            SOSP is well established as a venue where many of the leading results in computer systems of their time have 
            been presented. This workshop will contribute to the vitality of SOSP by contributing a rich problem context 
            to it. It will also expand the envelope of the conference to an area that shows high promise to influence our 
            world. Arguably the most famous industrial deployment is in Google’s Gboard which predicts, based on swipes, 
            what the next word is and this runs on hundreds of millions of Android devices. There are many other 
            large-scale deployments that are not as well known and importantly, many others peeking over the horizon. 
            We believe federated learning becomes more important as an ever increasing number of sensors in our 
            “sensorified” world generate ever increasing amounts of data and data processing moves to the edge.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <i>The key question is can this learning be done reliably and securely so that we can trust our private and 
            critical interactions to such systems.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This pendulum of moving from centralized infrastructure to a distributed infrastructure at the edge has swung 
            at least twice in our living memories and of course, no single point in the spectrum will be the universal 
            solution. The systems community has had a major role in shaping the movement in this arc. This workshop will 
            start the effort to keep the community engaged with an emerging point in the spectrum. The point in the 
            spectrum represented by federated learning seems particularly timely as it leverages two dominant trends in 
            our world:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Large amounts of data being generated at the edges of our systems, the deployment contexts becoming 
                    more dynamic, and the consequent necessity of learning and re-learning from this data. Obviously not 
                    all of the data can be brought back to the backend for enabling such learning. Hence the need for 
                    distributed and federated learning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As this paradigm catches strength, we expect that there will be deployments in application contexts 
                    where we care about the integrity of the results. Hence the need for reliability and security. The 
                    modalities that make this challenging are the insecure deployments of the nodes as well as the hardware 
                    and software constraints of the nodes.
