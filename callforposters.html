            <b>Federated learning</b> is a distributed machine learning approach that allows a global model to be trained 
            across multiple decentralized client devices. This offers privacy, accuracy, and scalability advantages 
            by utilizing multiple clients for training and using their local data. Since its inception in 2017, the 
            area has seen great strides on the theoretical side and to a lesser extent, on the practical deployment side.
        </p>
        <p>
            The natural progression of technology is that once some technology becomes usable and then useful at scale, 
            attention starts to get focused on the reliability and the security aspects of the technology. Distributed 
            learning is no exception. In some sense, the bar for this technology is high as this is meant to be used in 
            our private spaces, listening and learning to model our behavior and carry out our wishes with lightning speed. 
            <b>So this workshop invites papers focusing on the systems challenges and initial solutions to the problems of 
            reliability and security in federated and more generally distributed learning.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            The short papers of <b>2 pages length</b> in standard ACM two-column format (+ unlimited references) are meant to 
            present fresh design ideas, with some initial results that show feasibility of the ideas. Any topic within the 
            scope defined above is of interest. These will be presented at a poster session in the workshop and awards will 
            be given for the best poster(s). 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Some sample topics are:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    How to create a trusted execution environment on client devices, e.g., through novel TCBs?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can we certify the behavior of clients or the server, either continually or upon critical events?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can we guarantee the accuracy of the execution in the face of model or data poisoning attacks at the clients?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can we deal with network issues connecting clients to the federated server?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can we develop asynchronous algorithms for this setting?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can FL solutions leverage heterogeneity in the system, data, models and or clients?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is a compelling application scenario?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <b>Workshop Format</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will have three kinds of activities at the workshop:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Invited talks:</b> We will be inviting leading and emerging thinkers in the field to present at the workshop. 
            There will be no publication associated with these talks, but the talks will be recorded and made available 
            through the workshop website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Poster papers and presentations at the workshop:</b> Each poster paper will be 2 pages in length (plus references). 
            The poster session will be held using Gather Town which gives the feeling of actually moving about in a physical 
            space and multiple attendees interacting concurrently with the authors. This has been used to good effect in 
            forums like NeurIPS 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Panel:</b> We will have a panel focused on a set of closely related topics within the ambit of the workshop. 
            Examples would be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    What should we learn and what should we unlearn from computing systems to build reliable and secure 
                    distributed learning solutions? 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Can we learn reliably and in a privacy-sensitive manner while being agile to environmental changes?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is heterogeneity in distributed learning a blessing or a curse?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What are the killer apps for distributed learning?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How can academics, practitioners, and government collaborate in this space?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            After the workshop, we will aggregate a selected group of participants and author an article that serves 
            as a review and a vision of the road ahead. This follows in the line of such an article that has been done 
            on the topic from a ML standpoint[]. The organizers have in prior work authored several such papers [16-20].
